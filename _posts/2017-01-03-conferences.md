Software technology conferences are a great source of professional
development for people working in the software industry. At a
conference, you're exposed to the latest ideas, technologies, and techniques available. You have the opportunity to interact with peers and learn from each other's experiences.

# But are conferences worth it?

Most conferences aren't cheap. Some well-known conferences are really quite expensive. At the time of this
writing, earliest bird pricing for [QCon](https://qconsf.com/) and [UberConf](https://uberconf.com/) is near $1700 USD for the conference alone. Once, you add in travel and lodging if you don't live nearby, the cost easily exceeds $2000. Even more affordable, niche
conferences like [GopherCon](https://gophercon.com/) and [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/) are around $500 USD.

Whether your employer pays your way, or you do, this is a major expense that should be
evaluated and planned for maximum benefit.

# Why do we go to conferences?

Is it to watch the speakers present their talks? Hopefully,
that's not why anybody goes to a conference in 2017. Virtually all
conferences publicly release session videos shortly after the conference. YouTube is filled with conference videos even
organized into playlists for viewing ease. Other sites like
[Confreaks.TV](https://confreaks.tv/) and many others provide access to
conference videos very shortly after the end of the conference.

Studying this content at your leisure with the ability to pause and
rewind is a far superior way to absorb the
content then being in a specific room at a specific time with no pause
or rewind.

# Make the most of your time at a conference

While at a conference, take the time to engage with your peers. Make
connections and trade lessons learned. There is a wealth of information
in the conference that goes far beyond the speakers and their talks.

* **While at the conference**
  * Make sure to introduce yourself to your seat neighbors at each talk before it
begins and if possibly connect on LinkedIn or exchange contact
information.
  * Make sure to purposefully sit next to different people during each
talk and during each meal (if your conference provides meals).
  * Take advantage of every event organized by the conference. If there
  is an after-party, attend and continue to meet new people. Most
  conferences have hundreds of attendees, so to increase your odds of
  meeting great new colleagues for your professional network is a
  numbers game.
* **After the conference**
  * **Use what you learn** If the talk covers something relevant to your current work then it should be straightforward to
incorporate it. If it's not, then you can always write a prototype and
publish it to Github.
  * **Share knowledge** When you get back, give a talk or write a blog
post. It can be a brown
bag talk over lunch to your department or a talk at your local tech
meetup. This has a double benefit of conveying information to your peers and also
the act of preparing a talk will solidify your understanding of the material as you prepare to deliver it.
  * **[Submit a talk!](https://www.papercall.io)** Don't just go to learn and take away, but instead give back too. If the idea of giving a talk frightens you, then start small by giving a talk at a local meetup.
