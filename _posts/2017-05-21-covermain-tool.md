I just created a new Go utility named [covermain](https://github.com/vaskoz/covermain)

covermain can be installed easily if you have the [Go runtime](https://golang.org/doc/install) by following the instructions in the [covermain README](https://github.com/vaskoz/covermain).

I built this tool because I needed a simple code generator to build the scaffolding for simple command line applications. Specifically, covermain is used for the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) challenges I solve [here](https://github.com/vaskoz/hackerrank-go).
